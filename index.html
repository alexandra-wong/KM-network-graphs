  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>So far in medical education, most research on KMb has focused on the individual-level, that is how evidence use by medical educators is facilitated or constrained. What’s missing in the literature is the critical roles that organizations play and their organizational-level strategies. Our research examines interrelated organizations that do KMb work within a defined system, that is the Toronto Academic Health Science Network (TAHSN), using System Evaluation Theory. Using a multi-case study design, our research includes KMb organizations that formally connect researchers and practitioners and has KMb in their mission statements: the six selected organizations can be found listed in the top right diagram. To study organizational-level knowledge mobilization strategies, we are focused on structural network weaving, that is how people are interconnected across organizations, and in particularly, we are interested in longer-term cross-institutional affiliations. These include people who are staff, scientists and researchers, administrators, and more. To study structural network weaving, we use both quantitative network analysis, shown here, and qualitative interviews, which are in progress.
